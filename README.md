# SmallScriptsThatMakeLifeEasier
Just small batch scripts that I use to get reminded or save time with things I need to do often.

Sport Reminder - Used to run every hour to remind me to move a bit, use Task-Scheduler to time it (https://www.howtogeek.com/123393/how-to-automatically-run-programs-and-set-reminders-with-the-windows-task-scheduler/)
UniLinks - Used to open all necessary links at start to save annoying clicks
